Note:: you can use any programming language to solve this challenge. Please include a README file with instructions on how to run the solution.
Create a function that prints Mount Kilimanjaro using asterisks(start symbol *) , the function should accept the following parametersâ€¦

Function drawMountain(MaximumCharactersPerLine, incrementFactor, midCharacter, leftMountainBorder,RightMountainBorder);


** Constraints **

MaximumCharacters <= 100
incremenentFactor == 3
midCharacter can either be a dash(-) or a caret(^)
LeftMountainBorder will always be a forwardSlash
RightMountainBorder will always be a backSlash

On each line , print N number of asterisks with a mid character in the following format
On the first line of the mountain print either asterisk or midCharacter
On the left part of the mountain, print N/2 asterisks 
On the right part of the mountain, print N/2 asterisks
If N is an even number , print MidCharacter in the middle of the Mountain
If N is an odd number, print an asterisk in the middle of the mountain 
Middle is equal to (N/2)+1 , ignore remainders on the calculation (N/2) i.e N=7, N/2 will return 3

Note: The middle of the mountain is common on all lines. 
	Stop printing when increment factor <= 100
	The maximum number of lines printed will be <= (100/incrementFactor)
